- 👋 Hi, I’m @tmdcpro
- 👀 I’m interested in ... Everything.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning ... Kungfu. (The term gōngfu (功夫) literally translates to "achievement through time and effort", combining gōng (功, "work, achievement") and fū (夫, "time, effort"). While widely known as Chinese martial arts, gōngfu originally and broadly refers to any skill mastered through persistent practice and dedication, not limited to combat.<img width="634" height="95" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5b72e980-dd78-4945-8615-5fd65288330d" /> )
