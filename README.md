Just as traditional kung fu requires years of disciplined training, expertise in programming comes from consistent, deliberate practice. Writing code daily, debugging, refactoring, and solving complex problems mirror the repetitive forms (katas) practiced in martial arts. Platforms like Codewars even use the term kata for coding challenges, directly linking software practice to martial mastery.

Shuhari (Kanji: 守破離 Hiragana: しゅはり) ↙️
